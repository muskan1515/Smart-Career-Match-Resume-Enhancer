- **📁 Project Setup:**
  - Created base folder structure: `/frontend` (Next.js), `/backend` (Node.js), `/ai_service` (Python), `/docs`.

- **📄 Architecture:**
  - Added `architecture.md`:
    - Described frontend–backend–AI microservice flow.
    - Included OpenAI embeddings + FAISS + MongoDB data pipeline.

- **🧑‍💻 Frontend (Next.js):**
  - Initialized app in `/frontend`.
  - Created `/upload` page with Tailwind UI.
  - Form connects to backend for uploading resume + JD.

- **🔧 Backend (Node.js):**

### ✅ Progress Summary

### 🧩 File Updates

#### 🧩 AI Service
- ✅ `embedding.py`: Perform the semantic embedding of both the jd and resume and return json list of embedding vectors.
- ✅ `embeddings_cache.json`: Stores the embeddings vector by creating unique key referencing the data from which embedding to be created and stored in json form , so that when hit multiple times save the api call.
- ✅ `resume_final_score.py`: Handles keyword extraction, skill analysis, score, and recommendations.
- ✅ `resume_final_score.py`: Handles keyword extraction, skill analysis, score, and recommendations.
- ✅ `resume_match_engine.py`: Combines embeddings, FAISS, cosine sim, zero-shot classification, keyword/skill comparison, and final tips.
- ✅ `skills.txt`: Contains standard skill list used for matching.
- ✅ `frontend/resumeMatcher`: Contains standard skill list used for matching.

#### 🧩 Frontend
- ✅ `/resumeMatcher`: Contains all the upload logic to show the match-resume insights in clear proper way and also show the job fetcher and updated resume options to user.


### 📌 Summary
Integrated full pipeline for matching resumes and JDs:
- Embedding via OpenAI/Sentence Transformer
- Similarity check with FAISS + cosine
- Role detection using zero-shot
- Keyword + skill match with recommendations

# 🗓️ Logs - 2025-08-06

### ✅ Progress Summary
- Implemented global UI feedback mechanism (loader + messages)
- Integrated complete resume rewriting flow using GROQ API
- Enabled automatic `.txt` resume download from frontend
- Expanded backend API support for resume rewriting and routing

---

### 🧩 File Updates

#### 🧩 Frontend

- ✅ `store/globalSlice.ts`:  
  Added **global state slice** for `loader` and `message`. Enables consistent feedback system across the entire app.

- ✅ `components/Loader.tsx` & `GlobalMessage.tsx`:  
  Created reusable UI components to display global loading state and success/error messages triggered from Redux.

- ✅ `pages/resumeMatcher.tsx`:  
  Integrated new resume rewriting feature.  
  - Sends resume, JD, and missing fields to backend  
  - Receives rewritten resume as text  
  - Triggers `.txt` file download automatically.

---

#### 🧩 AI Service

- ✅ `resume_rewrite_engine.py`:  
  - New module using **Groq API** (`llama3-8b-8192`)  
  - Accepts: `resume_text`, `job_description`, `missing_skills`  
  - Returns: Rewritten resume filling in missing skills and tailoring to JD  
  - Ensures output is clean, aligned with role, and well-formatted.

---

#### 🧩 Backend (FastAPI)

- ✅ `controllers/rewriteResumeController.py`:  
  - Accepts POST request from frontend  
  - Validates inputs  
  - Calls `resume_rewrite_engine.py` to generate updated resume  
  - Returns JSON with rewritten resume string.

- ✅ `routes/rewriteResume.py`:  
  - Defines API route `/rewrite-resume`  
  - Linked to `rewriteResumeController`.

---

### 📦 Output Features

- 📝 Rewritten Resume returned as `string` in JSON response.
- 📄 Frontend automatically triggers download as `.txt` file named like:  
  `rewritten_resume_20250806.txt`

---

### 📌 Summary

Fully implemented **Resume Rewriting System**:
- Built on top of **GROQ’s LLaMA 3**
- Works with resume + JD + missing skills
- Clean pipeline across **AI Service → FastAPI → Frontend**
- Also created **global feedback system** with loader & message for smooth UX.
